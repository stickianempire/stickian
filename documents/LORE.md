## Summary

Many, many years ago, the Rubberian people were defeated at the Great War of the Rubberhand. Across the now Rubberfree land all stick-realms achieved life in peace, focused on prosperity and growth. However, not all kingdoms prospered together. King Ladstick, the III, was falling to despair. As the main general of the united realms, hero in the war, and decorated as the strongest general, he was left to rule a barren kingdom ravaged by the war. As he saw the coward neighbour kingdoms prosper from his kingdom's sacrifice, his jealousy increased. Instead of ruling his own kingdom he retreated into his inner chambers and plotter revenge. The land got poorer and the disparities bigger, people were left without ruler, as King Ladstick did not exercise the law.

One day, the king, now called by many King Madstick, ventured into the Forest of The Thousand Sticks, in a quest to find the dark wizard whom he thought could be the answer to his plan. The king knew the wizard would heed his call, as the wizard was in debt to the Ladstick family, but the risk of his request stroke fear in his heart nonetheless. He steeled his resolve as this would be done for the benefit of the kingdom, or so he thought...

The wizard, in vain, attempted to warn the king about the dangers of the request, but the king could see no other way out at this point. An army of undead, built from the rubber remains of the Great War, was the final demand. And so, with the spirit of the Mythical Eraser, the dark wizard travelled to the Rubberian graveyard, where no stickman would ever go, and managed to breath a second life to the Rubberian people raising a fearsome army that could conquer the world. These undead warriors, pink in skin, meant terror to every stickman, and they were an army ready for battle.

In a resentful rage and thirst for power, the Madstick drove his newly found army to his prospering neighbouring countries, and the first stick-cities were conquered. He was becoming unstoppable, however, he was blind to the wizard's warnings... His reckless greed led him to raise from the dead the once-loved Rubber Isho, the XVI, the last emperor of the Rubberian people. This undead rubber emperor wanted his revenge, and the Madstick king was on his way. So, the Rubber Isho mercilessly slew the Madstick king by slashing his massive sword slowly through the king's heart. in front of all the undead army, and claimed his crown as the undead emperor.

The Madstick kingdom has fell, but an huge army of undead Rubberian warriors and their emperor were now there to take their revenge over the life of peaceful stickmen. What is there to do? As a last resistance for the stickmen, the last colonies held strong in the cardinal points of the world, fighting bravely to survive! Under YOUR rule, will they be able to thrive? 

Will you help them reach victory, or will you fall into misery? The choice is yours.
